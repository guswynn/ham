# need to figure out how to split

n + n-1 + n-2 ..... + 1 into 4ths....
for an equal split:

  for large n, the greatest difference is 3n/4,
    so total difference is (3n/4)*n/4 = (3n^2)/16
    for n = 500000, this is 250 billion, not good
    

instead, split like this:



n   -> thread 1
n-1 -> thread 2 
n-2 -> thread 3
n-3 -> thread 4


n-4 -> thread 1
n-5 -> thread 2
n-6 -> thread 3
n-7 -> thread 4

and so on


so the max difference is ~500,000*4=2million ( i think), which is small compared the max number of
comparisons, around 124billion
